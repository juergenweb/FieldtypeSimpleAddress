# Processwire-Simple-Address-Inputfield-Fieldtype
A simple inputfield and fieldtype to store an address. There is no special functionality inside, but the big advantage is, that you donÂ´t need to use multiple fields in ProcessWire and each field of the address is fully searchable. Adding only 1 field is much more comfortable.

## What it does

This fieldtype let you enter various data of an address such as street, number, postalcode,....

### Output the values in templates

There's a property for each address item

```
echo $page->fieldname->street;
echo $page->fieldname->number;
echo $page->fieldname->postalcode;
echo $page->fieldname->city;
echo $page->fieldname->state;
echo $page->fieldname->country;
```

You can render a complete address string like

```
echo $page->fieldname;
```

This will output fe the following HTML:

```
<address>MyStreet 12<br>4020 Linz<br>Upper Austria<br>Austria</address>
```

If you want to customize your code, you should better use the following method in your template:

```
echo $page->fieldname->renderAddress(['separator' => ' - ', 'class' => 'myclass']);
```

This will output the following HTML:

```
<address class="myclass">MyStreet 12 - 4020 Linz - Upper Austria - Austria</address>
```

As you can see you have 2 options (optional) to control your output:

1. separator: This is the markup that should be between the various parts of an address 
2. class: You can add a CSS-class if necessary to style your address markup


### Use in selectors strings

The city (or other values) can be used in selectors like:

`$pages->find("fieldname.city=New York");`

### Field Settings

At the moment there are no settings included.

### To do

I have planned to include settings for required fields, so you can select if an inputfield should be required or not.
